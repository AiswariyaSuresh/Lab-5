# Lab-5
Using a text file as a "shopping list", had to create the following functions:
- bool fileExists(istream& in) : return true/ false if file exists or not
- printAll() : reads and prints everything from input file
- bool itemExists(istream& in): checks if item exists in the "list"
- void printMostExpensiveItem()
- void addItem() <br/>
<br/>

## What I learned:
- File Handling/ Processing in C++
